# TNAI Chat AI - Personalized Student Tutor 🚀

*AI-Powered Chat Assistant for Learning Support and Lesson Explanations*

## Introduction
**TNAI is an intelligent chat AI designed to support students in their learning journey. By personalizing responses based on user account data (e.g., progress history) TNAI provides tailored explanations, homework help, and motivational guidance. 

This repository serves as the central hub for the project's development, documentation, and prototypes—focusing on educational workflows like real-time Q&A for math problems, concept breakdowns, and adaptive lesson recommendations. Built with a Business Analyst (BA) lens, it bridges user needs with AI implementation for seamless, engaging student experiences.

**Key Goals:**
- Personalize tutoring using account data (e.g., past interactions) to adapt difficulty and style.
- Focus on core education support: Explaining lessons, solving exercises, and tracking progress.
